## üöÄ Quickstart

1. **Install Medusa CLI**
    ```bash
    npm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli
    ```
2. **Create a new Medusa project**
    ```
    medusa new my-medusa-store --seed
    ```
3. **Start your Medusa engine**
    ```bash
    medusa develop
    ```
    
4. **Use the API**
    ```bash
    curl localhost:9000/store/products | python -m json.tool
    ```

After these four steps and only a couple of minutes, you now have a complete commerce engine running locally. You may now explore [the documentation](https://docs.medusa-commerce.com/api) to learn how to interact with the Medusa API. You may also add [plugins](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages) to your Medusa store by specifying them in your `medusa-config.js` file.

## üóÑ Setting up Admin

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin medusa-admin
   cd medusa-admin
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**
   ```
   yarn start
   ```
4. **Go to [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000)**

## üõí Setting up a storefront for your Medusa project
Medusa is a headless commerce engine which means that it can be used for any type of digital commerce experience - you may use it as the backend for an app, a voice application, social commerce experiences or a traditional e-commerce website, you may even want to integrate Medusa into your own software to enable commerce functionality. All of these are use cases that Medusa supports - to learn more read the documentation or reach out.

To provide a quick way to get you started with a storefront install one of our traditional e-commerce starters:

- [Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa)
  ```
  npm install -g gatsby-cli
  gatsby new my-medusa-storefront https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa
  ```
- [Nextjs Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa)
  ```
  npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa my-medusa-storefront
  ```

With your starter and your Medusa store running you can open http://localhost:8000 (for Gatsby) or http://localhost:3000 (for Nextjs) in your browser and view the products in your store, build a cart, add shipping details and pay and complete an order.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Linking development to Medusa Cloud
With your project in local development you can link your Medusa instance to Medusa Cloud - this will allow you to manage your store, view orders and test out the amazing functionalities that you are building. Linking your project to Medusa Cloud requires that you have a Medusa Cloud account.

1. **Authenticate your CLI with Medusa Cloud:**
   ```
   medusa login
   ```
2. **Link project**
   ```
   medusa link --develop
   ```

You can now navigate to Orders in Medusa Cloud to view the orders in your local Medusa project, just like you would if your store was running in production.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features
Medusa comes with a set of building blocks that allow you to create amazing digital commerce experiences, below is a list of some of the features that Medusa come with out of the box:
- **Headless**: Medusa is a highly customizable commerce API which means that you may use any presentation layer such as a website, app, chatbots, etc.
- **Regions** allow you to specify currencies, payment providers, shipping providers, tax rates and more for one or more countries for truly international sales.
- **Orders** come with all the functionality necessary to perform powerful customer service operations with ease.
- **Carts** allow customers to collect products for purchase, add shipping details and complete payments.
- **Products** come with relevant fields for customs, stock keeping and sales. Medusa supports multiple options and unlimited variants.
- **Swaps** allow customers to exchange products after purchase (e.g. for incorrect sizes). Accounting, payment and fulfillment plugins handle all the tedious work for you for automated customer service.
- **Claims** can be created if customers experience problems with one of their products. Plugins make sure to automate sending out replacements, handling refunds and collecting valuable data for analysis.
- **Returns** allow customers to send back products and can be configured to function in a 100% automated flow through accounting and payment plugins.
- **Fulfillment API** makes it easy to integrate with any fulfillment provider by creating fulfillment plugins, check the `/packages` directory for a full list of plugins.

- **Notification API** allow integrations with email providers, chatbots, Slack channels, etc. 
- **Customer Login** to give customers a way of managing their data, viewing their orders and saving payment details. 
- **Shipping Options & Profiles** enable powerful rules for free shipping limits, multiple fulfillment methods and more.
- **Medusa's Plugin Architecture** makes it intuitive and easy to manage your integrations, switch providers and grow with ease.
- **Customization** is supported for those special use cases that all the other e-commerce platforms can't accommodate.

## Database support
In production Medusa requires Postgres and Redis, but SQLite is supported for development and testing purposes. If you plan on using Medusa for a project it is recommended that you install Postgres and Redis on your dev machine.

- [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Install Redis](https://redis.io/download)

To use Postgres and Redis you should provide a `database_url` and `redis_url` in your `medusa-config.js`.
